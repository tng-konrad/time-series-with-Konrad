    "**1. Core Data Science Imports:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `import numpy as np`:  Imports the NumPy library, which is fundamental for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, mathematical functions, and random number generation. `np` is a common alias used for brevity.\n",
    "*   `import pandas as pd`: Imports the Pandas library, essential for data manipulation and analysis. It introduces DataFrames, which are tabular data structures with labeled rows and columns, making it easy to work with structured data.  `pd` is the standard alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Statistical Modeling (statsmodels):**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section imports modules from `statsmodels`, a Python library focused on statistical modeling, econometrics, and time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf`: Imports functions for plotting Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF). These plots are crucial for identifying the order of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components in time series models like ARIMA.\n",
    "    *   `plot_acf()`:  Visualizes the autocorrelation between a time series and its lagged values.\n",
    "    *   `plot_pacf()`: Visualizes the partial autocorrelation, which shows the correlation between a time series and its lagged values after removing the effects of intermediate lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose`: Imports `seasonal_decompose`, a function used to decompose a time series into its trend, seasonality, and residual components. This is helpful for understanding the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import SimpleExpSmoothing, ExponentialSmoothing, Holt`:  Imports classes related to exponential smoothing methods:\n",
    "    *   `SimpleExpSmoothing`: Implements simple exponential smoothing, a basic method for forecasting time series without trend or seasonality.\n",
    "    *   `ExponentialSmoothing`: Implements double exponential smoothing (Holt's linear trend method), which handles data with a trend but no seasonality.\n",
    "    *   `Holt`:  Implements Holt-Winters' seasonal method, which can handle both trend and seasonality in time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Visualization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: Imports the `pyplot` module from Matplotlib, a powerful library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. `plt` is the standard alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Configuration/Styles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `import warnings`:  Imports the `warnings` module to manage warning messages that might be generated during code execution.\n",
    "*   `warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)`: Suppresses `FutureWarning` messages. These warnings indicate that certain features or syntax are deprecated and will likely change in future versions of the libraries.  Ignoring them can make output cleaner, but it's generally good practice to address these warnings when possible for long-term code maintainability.\n",
    "*   `plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')`: Sets the default plotting style to 'fivethirtyeight'. This is a visually appealing style often used in data journalism and provides a consistent look for plots.  It's defined within Matplotlib.\n"

    "*   `class CFG:`: This defines a class named `CFG`.  Classes are blueprints for creating objects. In this case, `CFG` is used to hold configuration parameters related to the project. It's a common practice in Python projects to group related settings into a dedicated configuration object.\n",
    "*   `data_folder = './data/'`: This defines an attribute of the `CFG` class called `data_folder`.  It stores the path to the directory where data files are located. The `./data/` means \"a folder named 'data' in the current working directory.\"\n",
    "*   `img_dim1 = 20`: Defines an attribute `img_dim1`, representing the desired width of images or figures (in this context, plots we will for visualization).  The value is set to 20.\n",

    "    *   `'figure.figsize'`:  This key specifies the default size of figures created using Matplotlib. It expects a tuple representing (width, height) in inches.\n",
    "    *   `(CFG.img_dim1, CFG.img_dim2)`: This provides the new figure size as a tuple.  It uses the values stored in the `img_dim1` and `img_dim2` attributes of the `CFG` class (which are 20 and 10 respectively)."
